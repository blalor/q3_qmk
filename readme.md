# This is blalor's `customized` branch

It contains my customizations for my Keychron Q3, forked from [Keychron's playground branch/fork](https://github.com/Keychron/qmk_firmware/tree/playground/keyboards/keychron).  See [`keyboards/keychron/q3/q3_ansi_stm32l432_ec11/keymaps/custom-no-via`](keyboards/keychron/q3/q3_ansi_stm32l432_ec11/keymaps/custom-no-via).
