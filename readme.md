# This is blalor's `customized` branch

It has my customizations for the Keychron Q3, originally forked from [Keychron's playground branch/fork](https://github.com/Keychron/qmk_firmware/tree/playground/keyboards/keychron), and now tracking [their PR](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/16912) to merge into the QMK mainline. See [`keyboards/keychron/q3/rev_0121/keymaps/custom-no-via`](keyboards/keychron/q3/rev_0121/keymaps/custom-no-via).

Also here is the Ploopy Thumb trackball, tracking [their PR](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/18214) into the QMK mainline.. See [`keyboards/ploopyco/trackball_thumb/keymaps/default`](keyboards/ploopyco/trackball_thumb/keymaps/default).
